## 📘 Yehia’s Web Dev Learning Vault

### 🚀 About This Repository
This repo documents my structured learning journey as I transition from mechanical engineering to full-stack web development. I'm currently pursuing the [freeCodeCamp Full Stack Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) aligned with [Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer). 

Inside, you'll find hands-on exercises, mini-projects, and concept notes designed to track my progress and reflect my growth. I’ve organized this vault not only as a personal learning archive, but also as a resource that others may find useful.
